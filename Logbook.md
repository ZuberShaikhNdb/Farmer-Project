## 🧑‍💻 **Challenges Faced**

During the course of the project, several challenges were encountered, which were addressed creatively:

1. **Farmer Tech Literacy**: A major challenge was ensuring the app’s usability for farmers with limited technological knowledge. To solve this, we focused on creating an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, supplemented by tutorials and local language support.
  
2. **Connectivity Issues**: Rural areas often face poor internet connectivity. To mitigate this, we optimized the app for low-data usage and offline functionality.

3. **Payment Security**: Integrating secure payment methods like Razorpay required thorough testing to ensure the protection of both farmers' and customers' financial information. This was handled by implementing encryption and compliance with industry standards.

4. **Market Trust**: Encouraging farmers to trust the app for selling produce directly was a challenge. We tackled this by building a reputation system with ratings and reviews, ensuring transparency and trust between farmers and customers.

5. **Location Accuracy**: Using Google Maps API for geolocation posed challenges in rural areas with limited address accuracy. We fine-tuned the system to allow for manual entry of location details when necessary.

## 📑 **Literature Survey**

In the course of developing the mobile app for direct market access, we researched several existing AgriTech platforms and studies that tackled similar issues. A few of the relevant studies and projects we examined include:

1. **AgriBazaar** – A platform for farmers to directly sell their produce to buyers, reducing the role of intermediaries.  
2. **Kisan Connect** – A mobile app connecting farmers to buyers and providing features like price discovery, weather forecasts, and crop advice.  
3. **eNAM (National Agriculture Market)** – A government initiative to create an electronic trading platform for agricultural commodities, aimed at improving market access for farmers.

These platforms have contributed to the development of our application by providing insights into the challenges of market access, technology adoption in rural areas, and consumer trust.

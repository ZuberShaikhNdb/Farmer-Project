### Abstract
This project aims to develop a mobile application to address the challenges faced by farmers in accessing 
markets and obtaining fair prices for their produce. The proposed solution is a user-friendly mobile platform 
that connects farmers directly with consumers and retailers, cutting out intermediaries. The app will enable 
farmers to list their produce, negotiate prices, and manage transactions. This direct market access approach is

The app should include features for listing produce, negotiating prices, and managing transactions, thereby reducing dependence on intermediaries. Expected Solution: A user-friendly mobile platform that enables farmers to showcase their products and connect with buyers directly, enhancing their income potential.

### Abstract
This project aims to develop a mobile application to address the challenges faced by farmers in accessing 
markets and obtaining fair prices for their produce. The proposed solution is a user-friendly mobile platform 
that connects farmers directly with consumers and retailers, cutting out intermediaries. The app will enable 
farmers to list their produce, negotiate prices, and manage transactions. This direct market access approach is 
expected to increase farmers' income potential and improve their livelihoods. The platform will be accessible 
via mobile devices and potentially through a web-based interface. This initiative is supported by the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and aligns with the themes of Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development.
